**Launchable** is a test automation platform which uses machine learning to adjust test suites to run the right tests at the right time in your development workflow.

We want to help teams dramatically reduce test cycle times to produce higher quality work, faster.

Our mission is to make it possible for all development teams to apply state of the art testing techniques within their environment, reducing the risk of changes, and delivering greater value to customers.

## With Launchable you can:

* **Create dynamic subsets of long running suites** that can be moved earlier in the development cycle. For instance, if you have a multi-hour test suite that runs post merge, you could create a subset that would run on every pull request that runs the most relevant tests to the changes in minutes, rather than waiting hours for tests to complete post merge.
* **Reorder test suites** running the most likely to fail changes, first. For instance if your test suite takes 40 minutes to run, on average when failures occur they will happen mid-way through the run. By reordering the suite based on likelihood of failure, you can get your failures at the start of the run rather than waiting 20 minutes or more to know that something broke.

The Launchable algorithm is language and framework agnostic making it possible to apply in many different environments.

## How we help developers

1. **Reduced anxiety and stress**: Developers aren’t overwhelmed juggling too many balls. Fewer balls in the air means fewer ones dropped.
2. **Reduced workload**: Developers get the right success/failure signals _in context_ while working on the relevant task. They don’t have to come back to old tasks days, weeks or months later.
3. **Increase in time**: Since developers get feedback in context of relevant task, they can resolve issues faster. This results in less wasted time. They can use this time to go back home earlier and spend time with family.

## How we help engineering leaders

With Launchable, engineering leaders gain:

1. **Predictability and credibility:** You gain credibility because your team can deliver predictability delivers quality software.
2. **Reduced anxiety and stress**: You aren’t overwhelmed dealing with escalations. Fewer escalations implies more time for intentional work. Fewer escalations means that there is reduced work. Fewer escalations implies that developers have more time to focus on what matters.
3. **Happier development team**: Bringing in modern practices that reduce the workload and stress makes your developers happier.
