# Getting started

## Overview

Implementing Launchable is a two phase process:

1. First, you send test results and build info to Launchable every time tests run in your CI pipeline. Launchable uses this data to build a model.
2. Then, you updated your CI pipeline to use the trained model to optimize test execution.

At a very high level, the eventual integration looks something like:

```bash
## build step

# before building software, send commit and build info
# to Launchable
launchable record build --name <BUILD NAME> [OPTIONS]

# build software the way you normally do, for example
bundle install

## test step

# ask Launchable which tests to run for this build
launchable subset --build <BUILD NAME> [OPTIONS] > tests.txt

# run those tests, for example:
bundle exec rails test -v $(cat tests.txt)

# send test results to Launchable for this build
# Note: You need to configure the line to always run wheather test run succeeds/fails.
#       See each integration page.
launchable record tests --build <BUILD NAME> [OPTIONS]
```

### Installing the CLI

The Launchable CLI is a Python3 package that can be installed from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/):

```bash
pip3 install --user launchable~=1.0
```

It can be installed as a system package without `--user`, but this way you do not need the root access, which is handy when you are making this a part of the build script on your CI server.

### Setting your API key

You should have received an API key from us already \(if you havenâ€™t, let us know\). This authentication token allows the CLI to talk to the Launchable service.

Youâ€™ll need to make this API key available as the `LAUNCHABLE_TOKEN` environment variable in the parts of your CI process that interact with Launchable. How you do this depends on your CI system:

* **Jenkins**: See [how to use credentials](https://support.cloudbees.com/hc/en-us/articles/203802500-Injecting-Secrets-into-Jenkins-Build-Jobs). The easiest thing to do is to configure a global â€œsecret text," then insert that into your job.
* **CircleCI** See [Using Environment Variables](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars/), which gets inserted as an environment variable.
* **GitHub Actions**: See [how to configure a secret](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets), which gets inserted as an environment variable.

### Verifying connectivity

You can run `launchable verify` to test connectivity. If successful, you should receive an output like:

```bash
$ launchable verify  

Platform: macOS-11.1-x86_64-i386-64bit
Python version: 3.9.1
Java command: java
launchable version: 1.3.1
Your CLI configuration is successfully verified ðŸŽ‰
```

If you get an error, see [Troubleshooting](resources/troubleshooting.md).

It is always a good idea to run `launchable verify` even for CI builds, as this information is useful in case of any problems. In that case, it is recommended to connect `|| true` so that the exit status is always `0`:

```bash
launchable verify || true
```
