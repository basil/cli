# Getting started

## Overview

Implementing Launchable is a two phase process:

1. First, you **record a build** and **record test results** every time tests run in your CI pipeline. Launchable uses this data to build a machine learning model.
2. Then, you update your CI pipeline to use the trained model to optimize test execution by **subsetting tests**.

How does this look in practice? Here's an example. Let's say you have a simple CI script that builds and tests your Rails app:

```bash
## build step
# build software
bundle install

## test step
# run tests
bundle exec rails test
```

After you've added Launchable, this script would look like:

```bash
## install the Launchable CLI
pip3 install --user launchable~=1.0

## build step

# before building software, send commit and build info
# to Launchable
launchable record build --name <BUILD NAME> [OPTIONS]

# build software as usual
bundle install

## test step
# ask Launchable which tests to run for this build
launchable subset --build <BUILD NAME> [OPTIONS] > subset.txt

# run those tests (note `-v $(cat tests.txt)`)
bundle exec rails test -v $(cat subset.txt)

# send test results to Launchable for this build
launchable record tests --build <BUILD NAME> [OPTIONS]
```

## Installing the CLI

The Launchable CLI is a Python3 package that can be installed from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/):

```bash
pip3 install --user launchable~=1.0
```

It can be installed as a system package without `--user`, but this way you do not need the root access, which is handy when you are making this a part of the build script on your CI server.

## Setting your API key

You should have received an API key from us already \(if you havenâ€™t, let us know\). This authentication token allows the CLI to talk to the Launchable service.

Youâ€™ll need to make this API key available as the `LAUNCHABLE_TOKEN` environment variable in the parts of your CI process that interact with Launchable. How you do this depends on your CI system:

* **Jenkins**: See [how to use credentials](https://support.cloudbees.com/hc/en-us/articles/203802500-Injecting-Secrets-into-Jenkins-Build-Jobs). The easiest thing to do is to configure a global â€œsecret text," then insert that into your job.
* **CircleCI** See [Using Environment Variables](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars/), which gets inserted as an environment variable.
* **GitHub Actions**: See [how to configure a secret](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets), which gets inserted as an environment variable.

## Verifying connectivity

You can run `launchable verify` to test connectivity. If successful, you should receive an output like:

```bash
$ launchable verify  

Platform: macOS-11.1-x86_64-i386-64bit
Python version: 3.9.1
Java command: java
launchable version: 1.3.1
Your CLI configuration is successfully verified ðŸŽ‰
```

If you get an error, see [Troubleshooting](resources/troubleshooting.md).

It is always a good idea to run `launchable verify` even for CI builds, as this information is useful in case of any problems. In that case, it is recommended to connect `|| true` so that the exit status is always `0`:

```bash
launchable verify || true
```

## Next steps

Now you can start training a model by [Recording builds](training-a-model/recording-builds.md) and [Recording test results](training-a-model/recording-test-results.md).
